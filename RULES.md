# Beast-Hunter
## a card game for two players
### Game Overview
Beast Hunter is a nail-biting asymmetrical card game for two players about the contest between a Hunter and their quarry, the Beasts. Points are scored by building powerful sets of cards using a simplified Poker-like system.  
Each player has a unique deck of cards consisting of an ace through ten of four different suits, two 'Annihilators', and a set of twelve special cards unique to each deck. Clever use of your special cards is key to strong play.  
The Hunter suits are: *Blades, Body, Arrows*, and *Traps*.  
The Beast suits are: *Scales, Feathers, Fur*, and *Wierd*.  
The Beast player will be laying sets of cards as 'Nests' face down, and trying to build nests of 5 or more cards which threaten to charge at the Hunter, and if the charge is succesful, score some points.  
The hunter will have to pick the right time and place to go on a hunt with a Hunter's Kit of up to 5 cards, and then compare the kit to the selected nest. the better set of cards scores.  
Play continues until a player wins by reaching 9 points.
  
Will the Hunter slay the Beasts?  
Or will the Hunter become the hunted?

#### The Play Area
each player should note the key areas of the game. 

__Beast Areas__:
 - The Beasts' __deck__, aka _the Hatchery_.
 - The Beasts' __face-up__ discard pile, aka the _Middens_. When the Beasts are defeated in a hunt or charge, the losing cards are placed face up in th middens.
 - The Beasts' __face-down__ discard pile, aka the _Bilnd_. When a Beast card is killed or discarded while not visible to the Hunter, it is placed face down in the Blind.
 - The Beasts' __hand__. AKA the _Droves_. The Droves are limited to 10 cards. If there are already 10 cards in the Droves and another would be added by drawing or roaming, that card is instead placed face down in the Blind
 - The __Nests__. Face-down piles of a number of cards. The left-to-right arrangement of Nests needs to be maintained during play. The heart of the action in Beast Hunter occurs when the Hunter decides to go on a _hunt_ in one of the Beast player's nests. This is when both sides can potentially best the other and score points.
 - The Beasts' __score area__ aka the _Oasis_. When a hunt fails, or when a charge is victorious, the cards from that nest are placed here face-up.
 
 __Hunter Areas__:
  - The Hunter's __deck__, aka _Home_.
  - The Hunter's __hand__, aka the _Supply_. The Supply is limited to ten cards
  - The Hunter's __discard pile__, aka the _Trash_. The Trash is always face up.
  - The __Kit__. When the Hunter goes on a hunt they select up to 5 cards to form the Kit, which is placed face-up on the table for the duration of the hunt. Kits are at most 5 cards.
  - The Hunter's __score area__, aka the _Glory Room_. When a hunt is succesful, the cards in that Kit are placed here, face-up.

### Turn Overview

### Beast's Actions in Detail

#### Roam
Roaming is, primarily, the way that the Beast player can draw new cards from their deck. However, it is also a way to move single cards to-and-fro very flexibly.  
When you choose to Roam, you can move a single Beast card from one location to another. In full, choose from one of the following options:
 - Roam one card from the top of the Beast deck to your hand.
 - Roam one card from your hand to the top of an existing nest.
 - Roam one card from the top of the Beast deck to the top of an existing nest.
 - Roam one card from the top of an existing nest to your hand.
 - Roam one card from the top of an existing nest to the top of the Beast deck.
 - Roam one card from the top of one nest to the top of another existing nest.
When a card roams to a nest, it always becomes the top card of that nest. In the case of card effects which cause multiple cards to roam to the same place at once, the Beast player chooses the order of those cards, but all of the newly roamed cards must be on top of the cards that were already there.  
Note: the card that the Beast player draws at the start of their turn does *not count* as roaming.

#### Nest
Playing a nest is the primary way for the Beast player to push the action forward. When you take the Nest action, choose any number of cards from your hand and place them ace down on the table. If there are already one or more nests in play, you must choose to place the new nest either to the left or right of those already in play.  

The order of nests in play must be maintained at all times. Nests next to eachother are considered 'adjascent' for the purposes of card effects. If a nest is removed from play by a hunt or other action, and it had an adjascent nest on both sides, those two nests become adjascent. There is no limit on the number of nests that can be in play.
