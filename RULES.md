# Beast-Hunter
## a card game for two players


## Game Overview
Beast Hunter is a nail-biting asymmetrical card game for two players about the contest between a Hunter and their quarry, the Beasts. Points are scored by comparing sets of cards using a simplified Poker-like system.  
Each player has a unique deck of cards consisting of an ace through ten of four different suits, two 'Annihilators', and a set of twelve special cards unique to each deck. Clever use of your special cards is key to strong play.  
The Hunter suits are: *Blades, Body, Arrows*, and *Traps*.  
The Beast suits are: *Scales, Feathers, Fur*, and *Weird*.  
The Beast player will be laying sets of cards as 'Nests' face down, and trying to build nests of 5 or more cards which threaten to charge at the Hunter, and if the charge is succesful, score some points.  
The hunter will have to pick the right time and place to go on a hunt with a Hunter's Kit of up to 5 cards, and then compare the kit to the selected nest. the better set of cards scores.  
Play continues until a player wins by reaching 9 points.
  
Will the Hunter slay the Beasts?  
Or will the Hunter become the hunted?

#### game materials

- These rules
- 1 Beast deck (54 cards)
- 1 Hunter deck (54 cards)
- a turn tracking wheel
- a turn tracking pawn
- a way to note scores. Pen and paper, notes app, etc.

#### Setup
1. Randomly select who will play the Beasts and who wil play the Hunter.
2. Give each player the corresponding deck, and shuffle them. Each player should place their shuffled deck near them on the table. 
3. Set the turn tracking wheel somehwere easily accesed by both players.
4. Set the turn tracking pawn between the 'Sunset' and 'Dusk' wedges on the turn tracking wheel.
5. Both players draw a starting hand of 5 cards.

You are now ready to begin play.

#### The Play Area
Players should note the key areas of the game where cards can be placed. 

__Beast Areas__:
 - The Beasts' __deck__, aka _the Hatchery_.
 - The Beasts' __face-up__ discard pile, aka the _Middens_. When the Beasts are defeated in a hunt or charge, the losing cards are placed face up in th middens.
 - The Beasts' __face-down__ discard pile, aka the _Blind_. When a Beast card is killed or discarded while not visible to the Hunter, it is placed face down in the Blind. When a card is "Killed blindly" it is sent here without being seen by the Hunter.
 - The Beasts' __hand__. AKA the _Droves_. The Droves are limited to 10 cards. If there are already 10 cards in the Droves and another would be added by drawing or roaming, that card is instead placed face down in the Blind
 - The __Nests__. Face-down piles of a number of cards. The left-to-right arrangement of Nests needs to be maintained during play. The heart of the action in Beast Hunter occurs when the Hunter decides to go on a _hunt_ in one of the Beast player's nests. This is when both sides can potentially best the other and score points.
 - The Beasts' __score area__ aka the _Oasis_. When a hunt fails, or when a charge is victorious, the cards from that nest are placed here face-up.
 
 __Hunter Areas__:
  - The Hunter's __deck__, aka _Home_.
  - The Hunter's __hand__, aka the _Supply_. The Supply is limited to ten cards
  - The Hunter's __discard pile__, aka the _Trash_. The Trash is always face up.
  - The __Kit__. When the Hunter goes on a hunt they select up to 5 cards to form the Kit, which is placed face-up on the table for the duration of the hunt. Kits are at most 5 cards.
  - The Hunter's __score area__, aka the _Glory Room_. When a hunt is succesful, the cards in that Kit are placed here, face-up.

## Turn Overview
Beginning with the Beast player, each player takes turns which they can perform a series of actions across several phases. In each phase, which corresponds to a time of day or night, you may take one out of a number of possible actions. Ater taking each action, move the turn tracking pawn clockwise to the next wedge of the wheel to track progress through turns. After the Beast has finished their turn, the Hunter begins their's, and vice versa.

The Beasts' turn proceeds like this:  
1. __Draw a card__ from the Beast deck. If there are 10 cards in hand, do not draw at this step.
2. __Dusk--__ You may *Charge* with one nest that contains at least five cards.
3. __Twilight--__ Choose one: *Roam* -OR- *Nest.*  
4. __Midnight--__ Choose one: *Roam* -OR- *Nest.*  
5. __Dawn--__ Choose one: *Roam* -OR- *Rustle.*  
6. The Beasts' turn ends and the Hunter's turn begins  

Charging, roaming, nesting and rustling will be explained in full later on.

The Hunter's turn proceeds like this:
1. __Draw a card--__ from the Hunter deck. if there are 10 cards in hand, do not draw at this step.
2. __Morning--__ Choose one: *Draw* a card -OR- *Hunt* -OR- *Shoot.*
3. __Mid-day--__ Choose one: *Draw* a card -OR- *Hunt* -OR- *Shoot.*
4. __Sunset--__ Choose one: *Scout* -OR- *Trap.*
5. The Hunter's turn ends and the Beasts' turn begins.  

Hunting, shooting, scouting and trapping will be explained in full later on.

## Beast Actions in Detail

#### Roam
Roaming is, primarily, the way that the Beast player can draw new cards from their deck. However, it is also a way to move single cards to-and-fro very flexibly.  
When you choose to Roam, you can move a single Beast card from one location to another. In full, choose from one of the following options:
 - Roam one card from the top of the Hatchery (Beast deck) to the Droves (hand).
 - Roam one card from the Droves to the top of an existing nest.
 - Roam one card from the top of the Hatchery to the top of an existing nest.
 - Roam one card from the top of an existing nest to the Droves.
 - Roam one card from the top of an existing nest to the top of the Hatchery.
 - Roam one card from the top of one nest to the top of another existing nest.
When a card roams to a nest, it always becomes the top card of that nest. In the case of card effects which cause multiple cards to roam to the same place at once, the Beast player chooses the order of those cards, but all of the newly roamed cards must be on top of the cards that were already there.  
__Note__: the card that the Beast player draws at the start of their turn does *not count* as roaming.

#### Nest
Playing a nest is the primary way for the Beast player to push the action forward. When you take the Nest action, choose any number of cards from your hand and place them face down on the table in an order of your choosing. If there are already one or more nests in play, you must choose to place the new nest either to the left or right of those already in play.  

The order of nests in play must be maintained at all times. Nests next to eachother are considered 'adjascent' for the purposes of card effects. If a nest is removed from play by a hunt or other action, and it had an adjascent nest on both sides, those two nests become adjascent. There is no limit on the number of nests that can be in play.

#### Rustle 
Rearrange the order of the cards in a nest.

#### Charge
Pick a nest containing at least 5 cards. The Hunter is forced to immediately choose a kit of up to 5 cards and make a hunt on that nest. Hunts are explained in detail in the next section.

## Hunter Actions in Detail

### Draw
Draw a card from the Hunter deck and add it to the Supply (the Hunter's hand).

### Scout 
Scoutis how you gain scant information about the Beasts' possible activities.  
You have three options when choosing to scout:
1. Scout a nest. You look at the top card of that nest.
2. Scout the Droves. You look at a card from the Beasts' hand, picked at random.
3. Scout the Hatchery. You look at the top two cards of the Beasts' deck and put them back in the same order. The Beast player does not see them.

### Shoot
Some special Hunter cards have the "SHOOT:" keyword in their text.  
If you have one of these cards in your Supply (hand), you may take the Shoot action in the morning or mid-day. Discard the card unless otherwise specified and follow the inscutions on the card.

### Trap
Some Special Hunter cards have the "TRAP:" keyword in their text.  
If you have one of these cards in the Supply, you may take the Trap action at sunset.  
Place the card face up on the table. As long as it remains on the table, it will have a persistent effect on roaming beasts.

### Hunt
Hunts are the core action of Beast Hunter.  
When you hunt, pick a set of up to 5 cards from the Supply (your hand) and place them face down on the table. then, chose a hunt target.  
Your target can be any nest in play, or the Droves (the beast player's hand) itself. When hunting in the Droves, all cards therein are considered to be in a nest and treated as such when resolving the hunt.

The steps to making a hunt are as follows:
1. Choose a nest in play, or the Droves. This is your 'target nest.'
  - You may _only_ hunt in the Droves if there are _no Nests in play_.
  - When the Droves are hunted, all cards in the droves form the target nest.
  - When hunted, the droves are not considered adjascent to any other nest.
2. Choose up to five cards from your Supply to make a kit. Place those cards faceup on the table, visible to both players.
  - A kit must be worth at least 1 point (before applying modifiers and effetcs) to be used.  
  - If the Droves are being hunted, place _all_ cards from the Droves face down on the table as the target nest.
3. Resolve any "KIT:" effects on special cards which come into effect before the target nest is flipped face up, as described in the card's rules (e.g. Machete, Zweihander).
4. __Flip__ the target nest face-up, making all cards visible to both players.
5. Apply any "FLIP:" effects listed on special beast cards in the target nest. In the case of multiple "FLIP:" effects in the same nest, the Beast player chooses the order to resolve them in.
6. Evaluate the power of the kit and the nest. The Hunter wins in the case of ties.
7. The set of cards with the higher power wins the hunt and is set in its player's score area. That player scores points equal to the kit's/nest's point value. Typically, a kit's/nest's point value is equal to it's power. However, there are special cards that only add power, or that only add points.
8. the losing set of cards is discarded, face-up.
9. The hunt ends and the active player's turn continues.

### Evaluating Power and Points

A set of card's power is determined with the following steps, in order:
1. The set's highest value __group of cards__.
2. Multipliers from __flushes__ and/or special cards.
3. Additions from special cards.

__1. Highest Value group of cards.__  
a _group_ is a set of cards that is either:  
A collection of like-numbered cards (i.e. a pair, three of a kind, four of a kind).  
_-or-_  
A straight run of cards (e.g. 3 \> 4 \> 5).  

A group's value is one less than the number of cards in that group. For example a three card straight has power 2.   
A 4-of-a-kind has power 3.  
If a set of cards has multiple groups, take the value of the highest group(s).
>__example__: in a nest containing three 5s and two 9s, only the group of fives adds power, being the higher group of cards.  
>__example__: The kit containing {Ace of Blades, 2 of Traps, 3 of Traps, 4 of Traps} has *4* power  

__2. Multipliers.__  
A straight flush, as in a straight of all the same suit, has its power doubled.  
For example, the group \{4 of blades, 5 of blades, 6 of blades\} has power 4 (one less than three cards is 2, then doubled is 4).  
In this step you also apply multipliers from special cards.

__3. Additon from Special Cards__  
Many special cards will add a flat amount of power to a set of cards. Make that addition here, after applying multipliers.  
For example, the Hunter card Breath simply adds +2 power to its kit. 

#### Annihilators and Aces
Any set of cards that includes an annihilator is considered to have infinite power, _unless_ the opposing set of cards inludes an ace. In that case the set of cards with the _ace_ is considered to have infinte power.  
In all _other_ cases, the ace is simply the 1 of its suit for the purposes of building card groups.  
If a Kit containing an Annihilator is up against a Nest also containing an Annihilator, the Hunter wins; the Hunter always wins ties.

#### Example of evaluating power
>A hunter's kit contains the following cards:  
>\{2 of traps, 3 of traps, 4 of traps, Limbs\}  
>This kit is evaluated like so: 
> 1. 3 card straight. 2 points.
> 2. Flush doubles points, bringing us to 4.
> 3. Limbs adds one. Leaving the total power at 5.

#### Evaluating Points
The point value of a winning set of cards is calculated in the same way as the set's power, but taking care to not add points for cards which only add power. Note that the Jacky Dragon special beast card adds both one point and one power to its nest.  
>In the example above, the kit would have 5 power, but be worth 4 points since Limbs only adds power and not points.

## Game End
The game ends as soon as one player has scored 9 points. That player is named the winner.

### Playing a series
Beast hunter is highly volatile within 1 game. It's totally possible to draw an amazing hand and score out in a few turns.  
While playing a single game is a ton of fun, experieced players may start to get annoyed with the occasional random blowout.  
In that case, It's encouraged to play a best-of-three series, switching sides between each game.  
Alternatively, You can play a series of 4 games, switching sides each time, and play for total score across games.  
In this variant, going for huge overkill-wins is incentivized. However, that might open you up to a sneaky comeback if you get too greedy. Have fun!

## The Special Cards

> Correlation to regular poker cards is noted.
