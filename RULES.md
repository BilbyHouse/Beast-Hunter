# Beast-Hunter
## a card game for two players
### Game Overview
Beast Hunter is a nail-biting asymmetrical card game for two players about the contest between a Hunter and their quarry, the Beasts. Points are scored by building powerful hands of cards using a simplified Poker-like system.  
Each player has a unique deck of cards consisting of an ace through ten of four different suits, two jokers, and a set of twelve special cards unique to each deck. Clever use of your special cards is key to strong play.  
The Hunter suits are: *Blades, Body, Arrows*, and *Traps*.  
The Beast suits are: *Scales, Feathers, Fur*, and *Wierd*.  
The Beast player will be laying hands of cards as 'Nests' face down, and trying to build nests of 5 or more cards which threaten to charge at the hunter, and if the charge is succesful, score some points.  
The hunter will have to pick the right time and place to go on a hunt with a Hunter's Kit of up to 5 cards, and then compare the kit to the selected nest. the higher hand scores.  
Play continues until a player wins by reaching 9 points.
  
Will the Hunter slay the Beasts?  
Or will they become the hunted?
